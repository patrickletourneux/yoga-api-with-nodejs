# Yoga API
48 poses composing what is possibly the only yoga API on the entire Internet. 

Icons are the work of <a href="https://thenounproject.com/hivernoir/collection/yoga/?oq=yoga&cidx=2">Claire Jones</a> via the Noun Project, except for sivasana (she skipped the most important pose!), which is by <a href="https://thenounproject.com/southofbelmar/">Elizabeth Sobka</a>.
